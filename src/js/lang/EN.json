			"title": "Frequently asked questions",
			"1": "What does the app cost?",
			"1a": "We have 2 types of users. On the one hand the users themselves and on the other hand the traders:<ul><li>The users pay nothing and have all functions immediately available. There are no hidden costs.</li><li>The traders can make their business stand out by making special offers to the users, e.g. in the case of a restaurant, a free espresso with a turnover more than 30$euro;. The type of offers is left to the traders themselves.</li> </ul>",
			"2": "What happens to my data?",
			"2a": "We want to gain maximum trust and are in no way out of collecting or selling data. We are convinced that users and traders will create a stable ecosystem on the basis of ${appTitle}, through which everyone has a great advantage and no disadvantages. That's why ${appTitle}'s source code is publicly available, so everyone can see what's stored in the code and how the data is further processed. You can find the source code here:<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/maniafschar\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/maniafschar</a>",
			"3": "How does your business model work?",
			"3a": "Business Spontis can buy additional services. These are only actively shown to Spontis with matching attributes. There is no such thing as classic-style advertising.",
			"4": "So do I see advertising everywhere in the app?",
			"4a": "No. You will only be shown advertising if an offer from a trader matches your settings. You get offers e.g. only because you like to eat Italian, you are close to the place and it fits into your budget. Classic-style advertising is not shown.",
			"5": "Are personal data displayed?",
			"5a": "No, we won't show your email to anyone. Your exact whereabouts will of course not be displayed either. Users can see that you are within 1.5 kilometers of them.",
			"6": "Can I delete my profile again?",
			"6a": "You can easily delete your profile in the settings. The data is then completely and irrevocably gone, a recovery is not possible. <br/> Despite the simple deletion option, our goal is to gain sustainable users who use our app in the long term and who are authentic. This simplified deletion process therefore primarily serves to build trust."
